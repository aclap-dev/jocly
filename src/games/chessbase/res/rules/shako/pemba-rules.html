<h1>Pieces</h1>

<h2>King</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/king.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Moves as in usual Chess, except there is no castling.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/king.png'>
</p>
<h2>Queen</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/queen.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Exactly as in usual Chess.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/queen.png'>
</p>
<h2>Bishop</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/bishop.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Exactly as in usual Chess.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/bishop.png'>
</p>
<h2>Knight</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/knight.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Exactly as in usual Chess.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/knight.png'>
</p>
<h2>Rook</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/rook.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Exactly as in usual Chess.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/rook.png'>
</p>
<h2>Elephant</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/elephant.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Moves one or two squares diagonally. When an Elephant moves two squares, it is allowed to jump, i.e., the intervening square does not have to be empty. The Elephant moves as the combined Alfil and Firzan (Ferz) from Shatranj, two pieces which were also present in mediaeval Chess and have disappeared with the birth of modern moves for Queen and Bishop.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>

</p>
<h2>Camel</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/camel.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Metamachy, a well known piece from medieval Muslim great Chess like Tamerlane's Chess. It jumps to the opposite case of a 2x4 rectangle, like an extended Knight. No matter what intermediate cases contain. Note that it always stays on the same color of square.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/camel.png'>
</p>
<h2>Cannon</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/cannon2.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>moves without taking like a Rook, but it takes by going in a straight horizontal and vertical line and jumping over exactly one piece. When a Cannon takes a piece, there must be exactly one piece between the original and final square of the Cannon's move - this piece may be of either color. (This is identical to the move of the Cannon in Xiangqi.)</p>

</p>
<h2>Giraffe</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/giraffe.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>a (3,2) jumper, it jumps to the opposite square of a 3x4 rectangle, like an extended Knight. No matter what intermediate squares contain. Note that it always changes the same color of its square. That piece is found in Alfonso X's Grant Acedrex (but its move has been rendered differently by 20th century historians). The same pattern, but with a non-jumping move, is found in Janggi, Korean Chess, for the Elephant. Under the name of Zebra, it is also a fairy piece used by problemists for compositions.</p>

<h2>Machine</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/machine.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>it is an orthogonal counterpart of the Elephant as it moves 1 or 2 squares orthogonally, jumping over the first square if it is occupied. Then, it combines the moves of old Dabbaba and Wazir found in ancient Muslim Chess variants. The word Dabbaba designated a siege machine at war in Arabic, hence the name given for this piece.</p>

<h2>Bow</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/bow.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Crocodile or bow : it is the diagonal counterpart of the Xiangqi's Cannon. It moves like a Bishop (which was named Crocodile in Grant Acedrex) and needs an intermediate piece between itself and its victim to capture it. The Crocodile jumps the intermediate and takes the victim on its square. The intermediate is left unaffected. Also known as Vao by problemists.</p>
