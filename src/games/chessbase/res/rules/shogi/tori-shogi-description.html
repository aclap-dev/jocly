<p>Tori Shogi ('Bird Shogi') is a variant of Japanese Chess on a smaller board,
whith mostly different pieces
It was invented by Toyota Genryu in 1799.</p>

<p>Only the Pawns and King move as in regular Shogi, even though they are called differently here.
Apart from the Pawns only one other piece can promote,
and the Pawn promotes to a quite weak piece.
This prevents the possibility of an impasse when both royals enter their promotion zone.
Otherwise the rules are identical to modern Shogi,
except that there can be two Pawns in each file.
