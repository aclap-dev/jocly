<p>Scirocco is a large chess variant inspired by historic European and Japanese chess variants.</p>

<p>Scirocco is remeniscent of Shogi variants from before the invention of piece drops.
In particular the fact that all pieces can promote without choice for what they become,
in a zone spanning multiple ranks, gives it a stong Chu-Shogi flavor.
Yet it also adheres to the European traditions of 8-fold symmetric pieces
and oblique leaps, and divergent Pawns.
The weakness of the initial pieces reminds of the Medieval Courier Chess
and Tamerlane Chess.

<p>Scirocco was invented by Adrian King in 1998-1999,
and the 'revised' version presented here stems from 2001.</p>
