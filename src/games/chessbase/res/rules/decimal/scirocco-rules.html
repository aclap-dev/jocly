<h1>General rules</h1>
<p>Scirocco is a chess variant on a 10x10 board.
Initially each player has 27 pieces of 18 different types.
Each of these pieces (even the King) has a distinct promoted form,
moving differently from the initial, unpromoted piece.
Promotion of a piece is always optional,
and can be done at the end of any move with it
that starts or end in the promotion zone
formed by the farthest three ranks of the board.
Once promoted a piece cannot unpromote or promote again.
</p>
<p>
A game is won by checkmating or stalemating the opponent,
or capturing all his non-royal pieces ('baring' the royal).
The latter finishes the game immediately,
so that it is safe to leave your King in
what otherwise would be check after the baring move.
Baring is thus similar to King capture,
making your last non-royal effectively royal too.
</p><p>
Repeating a position that occurred before also ends the game.
The player that made the last move (and thus caused the repetition) then loses,
unless none of the moves since the previous occurrence of the final position
by either player attacked anything;
in that case the game ends in a draw.
There is no limit on the number of reversible moves;
the only other way to draw is by mutual agreement.
</p>
<p>Other rules are as in orthodox chess. White starts to play.</p>

<h1>Initial setup</h1>
