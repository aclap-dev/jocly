<h1>Pieces</h1>
<h2>Champion</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/champion.png"/>

<p class='piece-details'>The Champion leaps two spaces in any orthogonal or diagonal direction, or one space in any orthogonal direction. It is a compound of the Alfil, Dababbah, and Wazir. It was introduced in Omega Chess, and it moves the same as it does in that game.</p>

</p>
<p class='piece-details'>The Wizard moves one space diagonally or leaps to a space one file and three ranks away or three files and one rank away. It is a compound of the Ferz and the Camel. It was introduced in Omega Chess, and it moves the same as it does in that game. </p>

<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/chancellor.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>It combines the move of Rook and Knight. It can be found in many, many chess variants since Carrera, Bird, Capablanca and many others like Grand Chess or Gothic Chess.

It is an Elephant in Seirawan Chess).</p>
