<h1>Initial setup</h1>

<p>The board is a 14 x 14 checkered squares with a white one at the right end of each player.</p>

<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/gigachess/gigachess-start.png'>
</p>

<p>There are 48 pieces per side:
<ul>
    <li>2 Bows, 2 Cannons, 2 Camels, 2 Ships, 1 Buffalo, 1 Lion, 1 Griffon, 1 Amazon, 1 Marshall, 1 Cardinal on 1st row, </li>
    <li>1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Princes, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 2 Rooks, 2 Elephants, 2 Machines on 2nd row, </li>
    <li>6 Corporals on 3rd row and 14 Pawns on 3rd and 4th rows. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The white King is placed on the center of the second row on a black square, the black King being on a white square. The Queen is also placed on the center, beside the King. The Amazon is just behind the King. On the 1st row there is the "animal side" with Griffon, Lion, Buffalo from inside to outside, and the "knighted side" with Amazon, Marshall and Cardinal in this order. On 3rd row, Corporals occupy the six central columns. </p>

<p>All short-range pieces (and the Ship as well) promote.</p>

<h2>Knight</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-knight.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Moves as in usual Chess. In addition, when a Knight reaches the last row it promotes to a Buffalo.</p>

</p>
<h2>Elephant</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-elephant.png'>

<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/elephant.png'>
</p>
<h2>Machine</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-machine.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>It is an orthogonal counterpart of the Elephant as it moves 1 or 2 cases orthogonally, jumping over the first case if it is occupied. Then, it combines the moves of old Dabbaba and Wazir found in ancient Muslim Chess variants. In this game, when the Machine reaches the last row it promotes to a Lion.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/machine.png'>
</p>
<h2>Lion</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-lion.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Metamachy, inspired (although with some simplification) by Chu Shogi, the most popular variant of the Japanese Chess. Here the Lion may move as a King (a single step move in any direction), or it may jump to a position two squares away, jumping in any orthogonal or diagonal direction, or alternatively jumping as a Knight in usual Chess. (Then this Lion has the same range but is more restricted than the Lion in Chu Shogi which can move two times in a turn). </p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/lion.png'>
</p>
<h2>Eagle/Griffon</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-griffon.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Metamachy, moves one square diagonally and then, goes away of an indefinite number of cases vertically or horizontally. It is authorized to go only one square diagonal. It can not jump and the unobstructed path must start with the diagonal movement. This piece is almost as powerful as the Queen and is inspired by the Giraffe from Tamerlane's Chess and the Aanca from Alfonso X's Grande Acedrex.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/griffon.png'>
</p>
<h2>Ship</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-ship.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Originally invented for Tamerlane 2000, it moves one square diagonally and then, goes away of an indefinite number of cases vertically, never horizontally. It can move one square diagonally only. It can not jump and must begin its move with the diagonal step. The Ship is more limited than the Griffon (which can move horizontally). Nevertheless its move power is comparable to the Rook and the Bishop. When the Ship reaches the last row it promotes to an Griffon.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>

</p>
<h2>Camel</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-camel.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Metamachy, a well known piece from medieval Muslim great Chess like Tamerlane's Chess. It jumps to the opposite case of a 2x4 rectangle, like an extended Knight. No matter what intermediate cases contain. Note that it always stays on the same color of square. When a Camel reaches the last row it promotes to a Buffalo.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/camel.png'>
</p>
<h2>Cannon</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-cannon.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Xiangqi, in Shako and in Metamachy. (Also known as Pao by problemists).</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/cannon.png'>
</p>
<h2>Bow</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-bow.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>It is the diagonal counterpart of the Chinese Cannon. It moves like a Bishop and needs an intermediate piece between itself and its victim to capture it. The Bow jumps the intermediate and takes the victim on its square. The intermediate is left unaffected. (Also known as Vao by problemists).</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/bow.png'>
</p>
<h2>Buffalo</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-buffalo.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Combines the leaps of the Knight (3x2), the Camel (4x2) and the Bull (see Terachess) (4x3).</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/buffalo.png'>
</p>
<h2>Marshall</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-marshall.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>It combines the move of Rook and Knight. It can be found in many, many chess variants since Carrera, Bird, Capablanca and many others like Grand Chess or Gothic Chess. (under many other names: Champion, Guard, Empress, Concubine, Chancellor, etc. The later is sometimes preferred, however it is confusing since Capablanca used it once for R+N and once for B+N. It is an Elephant in Seirawan Chess).</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/marshall.png'>

<div style='clear:both'></div>
