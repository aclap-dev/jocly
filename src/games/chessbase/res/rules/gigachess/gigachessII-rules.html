<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/visuals/gigachessII-600x600-2d.jpg'>
</p>
The pieces are:

The white King is placed on the center of the second row on a black square, the black King being on a white square. The Queen is also placed on the center, beside the King. 
<p>There are 48 pieces per side:
<ul>
    <li>1 Amazon, 1 Sorceress, 1 Marshal, 1 Cardinal, 1 Rhinoceros, 1 Buffalo, 2 Crocodiles, 2 Giraffes, 2 Camels and 2 Cannons on 1st row, </li>

    <li>14 Pawns on 3rd and 4th rows.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The white King is placed on the center of the second row on a black square, the black King being on a white square. The Queen is also placed on the center, beside the King. The Amazon is just behind the King. On the 1st row there is the "animal side" with Griffon, Lion, Buffalo from inside to outside, and the "knighted side" with Amazon, Marshall and Cardinal in this order. On 3rd row, Corporals occupy the six central columns. </p>

<h2>Rook</h2>

</p>
<h2>Elephant</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/elephant.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Shako. In this game, when the Elephant reaches the last row it promotes to a Lion.</p>

<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/elephant.png'>
</p>
<h2>Machine</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/machine.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>It is an orthogonal counterpart of the Elephant as it moves 1 or 2 cases orthogonally, jumping over the first case if it is occupied. Then, it combines the moves of old Dabbaba and Wazir found in ancient Muslim Chess variants. In this game, when the Machine reaches the last row it promotes to a Lion.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/machine.png'>
</p>
<h2>Lion</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/lion.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Metamachy, inspired (although with some simplification) by Chu Shogi, the most popular variant of the Japanese Chess. Here the Lion may move as a King (a single step move in any direction), or it may jump to a position two squares away, jumping in any orthogonal or diagonal direction, or alternatively jumping as a Knight in usual Chess. (Then this Lion has the same range but is more restricted than the Lion in Chu Shogi which can move two times in a turn). </p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>

</p>
<h2>Eagle/Griffon</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/griffon.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Metamachy, moves one square diagonally and then, goes away of an indefinite number of cases vertically or horizontally. It is authorized to go only one square diagonal. It can not jump and the unobstructed path must start with the diagonal movement. This piece is almost as powerful as the Queen and is inspired by the Giraffe from Tamerlane's Chess and the Aanca from Alfonso X's Grande Acedrex.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/griffon.png'>
</p>
<h2>Giraffe</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/giraffe.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>a (3,2) jumper, it jumps to the opposite square of a 3x4 rectangle, like an extended Knight. No matter what intermediate squares contain. Note that it always changes the same color of its square. That piece is found in Alfonso X's Grant Acedrex (but its move has been rendered differently by 20th century historians). The same pattern, but with a non-jumping move, is found in Janggi, Korean Chess, for the Elephant. Under the name of Zebra, it is also a fairy piece used by problemists for compositions.</p>

<h2>Camel</h2>

</p>
<h2>Cannon</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/cannon2.png"/>

<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/cannon.png'>

<h2>Archer</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/bow.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>It is the diagonal counterpart of the Chinese Cannon. It moves like a Bishop and needs an intermediate piece between itself and its victim to capture it.
