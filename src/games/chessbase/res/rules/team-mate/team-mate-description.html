<p>Team-mate chess is a variant with many different unusual pieces.</p>

<p>The idea behind team-mate chess was to have a variant where no single piece would be able (with the help of its own king) to force checkmate onto a bare king,
but where you would always need at least a pair of pieces (a 'team') to do that.
So that all basic checkmates become similar to the bishop + knight checkmate of orthodox Chess.
To get as many such different end-games as possible,
all pieces in the initial setup are different.
Furthermore, a piece type not present initially can be obtained through promotion.

<p>Team-mate chess was conceived in 2014 by H.G.Muller.</p>
