<p>Team-mate chess is a chess variant on an 8x8 board.</p>

<p>Except for the king and one knight all other pieces on the back rank are unorthodox, and different from each other.
From a-file to h-file each player has a unicorn, a phoenix, an elephant, an aanca, a king, a mortar, a knight and a cobra.
The king can castle in the usual way with the unicorn or the cobra.
Pawns are normal FIDE pawns, except that they can promote only to one of the initially-present pieces other than king or aanca, or to the (not-initially present) Adjutant.
From weak to strong the pieces are:
</p>

<h2>The Mortar</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"><img style='max-width:100%' src="{GAME}/res/rules/team-mate/mortar.png"/></p>

<p>Jumps directly to the 2nd or 3rd square diagonally, i.e jumping over any occupied intermediate square.</p>

<h2>The Elephant</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"><img style='max-width:100%' src="{GAME}/res/rules/team-mate/elephant.png"/></p>

<p>Steps diagonally one or two squares, leaping over the intermediate square if it is occupied.</p>

<h2>The Phoenix</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"><img style='max-width:100%' src="{GAME}/res/rules/team-mate/phoenix.png"/></p>

<p>Steps one square orthogonally,
or jumps two squares diagonally,
leaping over the intermediate square if it is occupied.</p>

<h2>The Unicorn</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"><img style='max-width:100%' src="{GAME}/res/rules/team-mate/unicorn.png"/></p>

<p>Steps one square orthogonally, or moves like an orthodox knight.</p>

<h2>The Cobra</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"><img style='max-width:100%' src="{GAME}/res/rules/team-mate/cobra.png"/></p>

<p>Moves like an orthodox knight, but when this lands on an empty square,
it can optionally slide on to the next square in the long direction of the initial knight jump.</p>

<h2>The Adjutant</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"><img style='max-width:100%' src="{GAME}/res/rules/team-mate/adjutant.png"/></p>

<p>Moves like an orthodox bishop,
or like a rook that moves only an even number of steps,
unobstructed by anything an odd number odd squares away.</p>

<h2>The Acromantula</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"><img style='max-width:100%' src="{GAME}/res/rules/team-mate/aanca.png"/></p>

<p>Slides along a bent trajectory,
starting with an orthogonal step,
and then continuing in an outward diagonal direction.
It cannot pass beyond any obstacle it encounters along this path.</p>

<p>The king, knight and pawn move like in orthodox chess; also castling is as in usual chess, with the pieces in the corners as partner.
Pawns promote on the eighth row of the board to Mortar, Elephant, Phoenix, Knight, Unicorn, Cobra or Adjutant, to the owning players choice.</p>

<p>A draw can be claimed after 64 moves (rather than 50) without capture or pawn advance.</p>

<p>Other rules are as in orthodox chess. White starts to play.</p>

<p>Each player commands 16 pieces.
<ul>
<li>1 king</li>
<li>1 acromantula</li>
<li>1 cobra</li>
<li>1 unicorn</li>
<li>1 knight</li>
<li>1 phoenix</li>
<li>1 elephant</li>
<li>1 mortar</li>
<li>8 pawns</li>
</ul>
</p>
