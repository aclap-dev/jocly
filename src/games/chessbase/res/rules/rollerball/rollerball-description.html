<p></p>Rollerball was a science-fiction movie in the 70's about an imaginary sport game where two teams from a World urban league were fighting on a skating ring . The players were running after each other and their clashes were violent and rough like in American football. This chessgame tries to retrieve the idea.</p>

<p>Rollerball chess has an entry in D.B.Pritchard's "The Classified Encyclopedia of Chess Variants" (2007).</p>
