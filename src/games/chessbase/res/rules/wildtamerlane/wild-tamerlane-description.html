<p>This game is a variant of <a href="http://history.chess.free.fr/tamerlane2.htm">Tamerlane 2000.</a></p>

<p>The fact that strong pieces can only appear after promotion gives an original taste to this large Chess Variant but can appear
    as too slow to some modern players. Those looking for strategies around "bloody" battles, may appreciate a simple this variant
    where Princes and Ship are replaced by Queens and Eagles (i.e. Gryphons) from the initial set-up.</p>
