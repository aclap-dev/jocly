<p>Makromachy is a huge chess variant (2x56 pieces on a 14x14 board)</p>

<p>
What distinguishes Makromachy from most other huge variants is that it is not just a mass of strong to super-strong pieces piled up on a board:
special care is taken to speed up the game, by various methods.
The piece density is larger than the usual 50%, bringing the armies closer together for earlier contact.

<p>
A hand-full of pieces that can jump over arbitrary many others to capture or check put the Kings in jeopardy from the very beginning,
so that checkmates don't have to wait until more than some 40 pieces are traded away.
A super-strong piece capable of hit-and-run capture is subject to an anti-trading rule that will make it survive until very late in the game,
so that the game doesn't easily get boring.

<p>
What would normally be the slowest pieces, (such as Knights), have an extra 'airlift' non-capture move that can quickly bring them to where the action is,
without making them significantly stronger.
There also is a second rank of Pawnish pieces in the rear guard, to provide King shelter, and preserve promotion options.
Care is taken that this cannot lead to unassailable double walls of Pawns, though.
Not all pieces are super-strong (although many are stronger than a Queen);
many of the unorthodox pieces are of Knight or Rook class, to provide good 2-vs-1 trading opportunities in any range of the value spectrum.
