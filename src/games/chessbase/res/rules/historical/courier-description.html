<p>Courier Chess is a 12x8 board variant of chess probably created in the 12th century, Germany.</p>
<p>The game would have survived until the beginning of the 19th century in Germany and some neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>Some say Courier Chess created the modern bishop moves: unlimited diagonals. Before this the so called Medieval Bishop (Archer in Courier chess) was moving like an Alfil (Elephant): two squares diagonally, leaping the first square.</p>
