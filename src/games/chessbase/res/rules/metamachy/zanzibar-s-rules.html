<h1>Presentation</h1>

<p>The games of Zanzibar have been invented in the process of creating and optimizing Zanzibar-XXL (Maasai Chess). However, two versions, called Zanzibar-S and Zanzibar-XL, present their own interest and they met a certain success. With the Pawns on the 3rd row and no Soldiers, those games have "rapid" Pawns and Princes playing like in Metamachy. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/invention/zanzibar-s" target="_blank">Zanzibar-S</a> is the moderate version. It is still close to Metamachy, its parent game.  </p>

<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/visuals/zanzibar-600x600-2d.jpg'>
</p>

<p>There are 36 for each player:</p>
<p> King, 1 Queen, 1 Eagle, 1 Lion, 1 Rhinoceros, 1 Buffalo, 2 Princes, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 2 Camels, 2 Rooks, 2 Cannons, 2 Elephants, 2 Giraffes, 2 bows, 2 Machines and 10 Pawns. </p>
<p>In Zanzibar-S there is no Duchess and no Sorceress.</p>
<p>Goal is checkmate the opposing King.</p>


<h1>Moves</h1>
<p><div class="meta-icon mi-king"></div>King: moves 1 step in every (8) directions on a not attacked square. The King is in check if it is attacked by one or several ennemy pieces. It is forbidden to play a move letting his King in check. At his first move, the King can make a 2-steps jump, horizontally, vertically, diagonally or like a Knight, providing that he is not in check and that the overpassed and the arrival squares are not under attack. The overpassed square may be free or occupied.</p>

<h1>Pieces</h1>

<h2>King</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-king.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>moves 1 step in every (8) directions on a not attacked square. The King is in check if it is attacked by one or several enemy pieces. It is forbidden to play a move letting his King in check.

There is no castling in Zanzibar. At his first move, the King may jump to a free square at two squares' distance. For instance, from f2, it can jump to d1, d2, d3, d4, e4, f4, g4, h4, h3, h2 or h1). It does not matter if the square jumped over is occupied or not; however, the jump is forbidden if that intermediate square is threatened by an enemy piece. When jumping like a Knight, at least one of the two intermediate squares must be free of threat (e.g., if jumping from f2 to h3, either g2 or g3 must not be under attack). The King's jump is not permitted if the King is in check. This rule, which was once prevalent in medieval European chess, replaces castling. Identical to Metamachy. </p>

<h2>Queen</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-queen.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Exactly as in usual Chess.</p>

<h2>Bishop</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-bishop.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Exactly as in usual Chess.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/bishop.png'>
</p>
<h2>Knight</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-knight.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Moves as in usual Chess. In addition, when a Knight reaches the last row it promotes to a Buffalo.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/knight.png'>
</p>
<h2>Rook</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-rook.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Exactly as in usual Chess.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/rook.png'>
</p>
<h2>Elephant</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-elephant.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Shako. In this game, when the Elephant reaches the last row it promotes to a Lion.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/elephant.png'>
</p>
<h2>Machine</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-machine.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>It is an orthogonal counterpart of the Elephant as it moves 1 or 2 cases orthogonally, jumping over the first case if it is occupied. Then, it combines the moves of old Dabbaba and Wazir found in ancient Muslim Chess variants. In this game, when the Machine reaches the last row it promotes to a Lion.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/machine.png'>
</p>
<h2>Lion</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-lion.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Metamachy, inspired (although with some simplification) by Chu Shogi, the most popular variant of the Japanese Chess. Here the Lion may move as a King (a single step move in any direction), or it may jump to a position two squares away, jumping in any orthogonal or diagonal direction, or alternatively jumping as a Knight in usual Chess. (Then this Lion has the same range but is more restricted than the Lion in Chu Shogi which can move two times in a turn). </p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/lion.png'>
</p>
<h2>Eagle</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-eagle.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Metamachy, moves one square diagonally and then, goes away of an indefinite number of cases vertically or horizontally. It is authorized to go only one square diagonal. It can not jump and the unobstructed path must start with the diagonal movement. This piece is almost as powerful as the Queen and is inspired by the Giraffe from Tamerlane's Chess and the Aanca from Alfonso X's Grande Acedrex.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/eagle.png'>
</p>
<h2>Giraffe</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-giraffe.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>a (3,2) jumper, it jumps to the opposite square of a 3x4 rectangle, like an extended Knight. No matter what intermediate squares contain. Note that it always changes the same color of its square. That piece is found in Alfonso X's Grant Acedrex (but its move has been rendered differently by 20th century historians). The same pattern, but with a non-jumping move, is found in Janggi, Korean Chess, for the Elephant. Under the name of Zebra, it is also a fairy piece used by problemists for compositions.</p>

<h2>Camel</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-camel.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Metamachy, a well known piece from medieval Muslim great Chess like Tamerlane's Chess. It jumps to the opposite case of a 2x4 rectangle, like an extended Knight. No matter what intermediate cases contain. Note that it always stays on the same color of square. When a Camel reaches the last row it promotes to a Buffalo.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/camel.png'>
</p>
<h2>Prince</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-prince.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>a non-royal King who moves and captures one square in any direction, but without being hindered by check. Like the Pawn, he can also move without capturing to the second square straight ahead.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/prince2.png'>
</p>
<h2>Cannon</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-cannon.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Xiangqi, in Shako and in Metamachy. (Also known as Pao by problemists).</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/cannon.png'>
</p>
<h2>Bow</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-bow.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>It is the diagonal counterpart of the Chinese Cannon. It moves like a Bishop and needs an intermediate piece between itself and its victim to capture it. The Bow jumps the intermediate and takes the victim on its square. The intermediate is left unaffected. (Also known as Vao by problemists).</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/bow.png'>
</p>
<h2>Bull</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Jumps to the opposite case of a 3x4 rectangle, like an extended Knight. No matter what intermediate cases contain. Note that it always changes the same color of its square. The same move is found in Janggi, Korean Chess, for the Elephant. Under the name of Zebra, it is also a fairy piece used by problemists for compositions. When a Bull reaches the last row it promotes to a Buffalo.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>

</p>
<h2>Rhinoceros</h2>
<p>

<h1>Setup rules</h1>

<p>At the beginning all pieces but the Kings, Queens, Eagles, Lions, Rhinoceros and buffalo are placed.</p>


<p>Then, Black freely decides where to place his King, Queen, Eagle and Lion on squares f1, g1, f2 and g2.</p>

<p>Then, White put his pieces symetrically in mirror (if Black King is on f1, White King goes on f12) and makes the first move.</p>

<p>This agreement balances the advantage of White starting to play with Black choosing the setup.</p>

<p>As pieces are placed in mirror symetry, positions of Kings on f squares are exactly equivalent of positions of King on g squares. Then, it can be demonstrated that it exists 12 different starting positions:</p>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li>The King can be on f1 or f2: 2 choices</li>
		<li>Then, the Queen has a choice of 3 positions: beside the King, beneath the King or diagonal to the King.</li>
		<li>Then, the Eagle has a choice of 2 remaining positions.</li>
		<li>Then, the left place is for the Lion.</li>
		<li>Then, the Rhinoceros has a choice of 2 remaining positions.</li>
		<li>Then, the left place is for the Buffalo. 2x3x2x2 = 24.</li>
	</ul>
