<h1>Initial setup</h1>


<p>The board has 12 x 12 squares. </p>

<h1>Pieces</h1>

<h2>Elephant</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/elephant.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Moves one or two squares diagonally. When an Elephant moves two squares, it is allowed to jump, i.e., the intervening square does not have to be empty. The Elephant moves as the combined Alfil and Firzan (Ferz) from Shatranj, two pieces which were also present in mediaeval Chess and have disappeared with the birth of modern moves for Queen and Bishop.</p>

<h2>Camel</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/camel.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Metamachy, a well known piece from medieval Muslim great Chess like Tamerlane's Chess. It jumps to the opposite case of a 2x4 rectangle, like an extended Knight. No matter what intermediate cases contain. Note that it always stays on the same color of square.</p>

</p>
<h2>Cannon</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/cannon2.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>moves without taking like a Rook, but it takes by going in a straight horizontal and vertical line and jumping over exactly one piece. When a Cannon takes a piece, there must be exactly one piece between the original and final square of the Cannon's move - this piece may be of either color. (This is identical to the move of the Cannon in Xiangqi.)</p>

</p>
<h2>Gryphon</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/griffon.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Moves one square diagonally and then, goes away of an indefinite number of cases vertically or horizontally. It is authorized to go only one square diagonal. It can not jump and the unobstructed path must start with the diagonal movement. This piece is almost as powerful as the Queen and is inspired by the Giraffe from Tamerlane's Chess and the Aanca from Alfonso X's Grande Acedrex. In my other more recent chess variants, this piece is called an Eagle.</p>

<h2>Prince</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/prince.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>A non-royal King who moves and captures one square in any direction, but without being hindered by check. Like the Pawn, he can also move without capturing to the second square straight ahead. When he reaches the last row it can promote to Queen, Gryphon or Lion.</p>
