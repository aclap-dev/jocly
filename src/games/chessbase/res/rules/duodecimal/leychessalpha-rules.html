</p>

<h2>Pawn</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-pawn.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>The Pawn is almost similar to usual Chess. There is a difference: it can advance one or two square from ANY position on the board. However, its capturing move is unchanged: one square diagonally forward. As a consequence, the en-passant capture is possible every time the opposite Pawn or Corporal or Prince has advanced two squares.</p>

</p>
<h2>Prince</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-admiral.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>This piece is simply a non-royal King combined with a Pawn. It can be found in Metamachy and has been inspired by medieval games like the Courier chess , an old chess variant, played in Germany, where it is called "Man". It moves one square in an arbitrary direction, like the King, but without being hindered by check. Here, like the Pawn, he can move without capturing to the second square straight ahead. When the Prince reaches the last row it promotes to an Emperor.</p>

<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-lion.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Metamachy, inspired (although with some simplification) by Chu Shogi, the most popular variant of the Japanese Chess. Here the Lion may move as a King (a single step move in any direction), or it may jump to a position two squares away, jumping in any orthogonal or diagonal direction, or alternatively jumping as a Knight in usual Chess. (Then this Lion has the same range but is more restricted than the Lion in Chu Shogi which can move two times in a turn). </p>
