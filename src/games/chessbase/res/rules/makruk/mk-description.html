<p>Makruk is a Thai Chess variant.</p>
<p>Millions of Thais know its rules yet only a few thousands of them would know how to play International Chess.</p>
<p>Not much information about when it was created but it is ancient and is probably descending from the 6th-century Indian game of chaturanga.</p>
