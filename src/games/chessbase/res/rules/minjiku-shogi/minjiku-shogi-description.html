<p>Minjiku Shogi is a very wild Shogi variant, that despite its large size (2x32 pieces on 10x10) can be quickly decided</p>

<p>
Minjiku Shogi is basically a miniaturized version of Tenjiku Shogi (which has more than double the number of pieces);
the participating pieces are mostly novel, 'caricatures' of the Tenjiku pieces, adapted to the smaller board.
</p>
<p>
A hand-full of pieces that can jump over arbitrary many others to capture or check put the Kings in jeopardy from the very beginning,
so that checkmates don't have to wait until more than some 40 pieces are traded away.
Indeed white can already threaten mate in 1 on its first move!
A super-strong piece can burn its neighbors, and capture 5 pieces at once this way.
</p>
<p>
As is typical for Shogi, most pieces can promote (once!) to a predetermined stronger piece.
So apart from the 16 piece types in the inital setup,
many appear also in a versions that cannot be further promoted, and 4 entirely new types can be obtained by promotion.
