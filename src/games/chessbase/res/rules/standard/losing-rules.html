<p>Losing Chess is a game played by two people on a chessboard, with sixteen pieces (of six types) for each player. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. 
The goal of the game is be unable to make a move, either by not having any piece left on the board, or
by having all remaining pieces blocked.</p>

<p>Losing Chess follows the normal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess" target="_blank">Chess rules</a>,
with the following changes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>capturing is compulsary: if there is a possible move that captures an opponent's piece, then
		any move that does not result in a capture is invalid</li>
	<li>the king has no special status: it can be captured and checks are not considered</li>
	<li>castling is not possible</li>
	<li>a pawn reaching the last row can promote to a king (in addition to Knight, Bishop, Rook and Queen)</li>
	<li>stalemate is a win for the player that cannot make a move</li>
</ul>
