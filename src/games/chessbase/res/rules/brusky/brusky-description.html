<p>Invented in 1966 by Yakov Brusky, this board has 84 hexagonal cells with a different orientation from Glinski chess which leads to different pawns movements.</p>
<p>Each team has a classical set of pieces except there are 10 pawns and 3 bishops (hexagonal boards have 3 different colors instead of 2 like in orthodox chess)</p>
