<h1>Initial setup</h1>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/terachess/terachess-start.png'>
</p>

<p>The board is a 16 x 16 checkered squares with a white one at the right end of each player.</p>

<p>There are 64 pieces per side:
<ul>
    <li>1 Amazon, 1 Marshall, 1 Cardinal, 1 Star, 1 Rhinoceros, 1 Buffalo, 2 Cannons, 2 Bulls,</li>
    <li>2 Bows, 2 Camels, 2 Antelopes on 1st row,</li>
    <li>1 Lion, 1 Eagle and 14 Corporals on 2nd row,</li>
    <li>1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Princes, 2 Ships, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 2 Rooks, 2 Machines,</li>
    <li>2 Elephants on 3rd row,</li>
    <li>16 Pawns on 4th row.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The white King is placed on the center of the third row on a black square, the black King being on a white square. The Queen lays beside the King. The Eagle is just behind the King, and the Lion is beside the Queen. They are the only major pieces on the second raw, the rest being populated by the Corporals. On the 1st row, the Amazon is in the back line of the King and commands a side with Marshall and Cardinal. On the opposite side, there is the Star on Queen side with Rhinoceros and Buffalo.</p>

<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-king.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Exactly as in usual Chess.</p>

<h2>Queen</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Exactly as in usual Chess.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/queen.png'>
</p>
<h2>Bishop</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-bishop.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Exactly as in usual Chess.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/bishop.png'>
</p>
<h2>Knight</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-knight.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Moves as in usual Chess. In addition, when a Knight reaches the last row it promotes to a Buffalo.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/knight.png'>
</p>
<h2>Rook</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-rook.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Exactly as in usual Chess.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/rook.png'>
</p>
<h2>Pawn</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-pawn.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>The Pawn is almost similar to usual Chess. There is a difference: it can advance one or two square from ANY position on the board. However, its capturing move is unchanged: one square diagonally forward. As a consequence, the en-passant capture is possible every time the opposite Pawn or Corporal or Prince has advanced two squares. When the Pawn reaches the last row it promotes to a Queen.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/pawn.png'>
</p>
<h2>Corporal</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-corporal.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>An extended Pawn. He can advance one or two square from any position on the board and its capturing move is one square diagonally forward. The improvement is that the Corporal can also advance 1 step diagonally forward. (So, with or without capturing). The Corporal can take en-passant every time an opposite Pawn or Corporal or Prince has advanced two squares. Promotes to Queen on last row.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/corporal.png'>
</p>
<h2>Prince</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-prince.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>This piece is simply a non-royal King combined with a Pawn. It can be found in Metamachy and has been inspired by medieval games like the Courier chess , an old chess variant, played in Germany, where it is called "Man". It moves one square in an arbitrary direction, like the King, but without being hindered by check. Here, like the Pawn, he can move without capturing to the second square straight ahead. When the Prince reaches the last row it promotes to an Amazon.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>

<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/prince.png'>
</p>
<h2>Elephant</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-elephant.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Shako. In this game, when the Elephant reaches the last row it promotes to a Lion.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/elephant.png'>
</p>
<h2>Machine</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-machine.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>It is an orthogonal counterpart of the Elephant as it moves 1 or 2 cases orthogonally, jumping over the first case if it is occupied. Then, it combines the moves of old Dabbaba and Wazir found in ancient Muslim Chess variants. In this game, when the Machine reaches the last row it promotes to a Lion.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/machine.png'>
</p>
<h2>Lion</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-lion.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Metamachy, inspired (although with some simplification) by Chu Shogi, the most popular variant of the Japanese Chess. Here the Lion may move as a King (a single step move in any direction), or it may jump to a position two squares away, jumping in any orthogonal or diagonal direction, or alternatively jumping as a Knight in usual Chess. (Then this Lion has the same range but is more restricted than the Lion in Chu Shogi which can move two times in a turn). </p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/lion.png'>
</p>
<h2>Eagle</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-eagle.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Metamachy, moves one square diagonally and then, goes away of an indefinite number of cases vertically or horizontally. It is authorized to go only one square diagonal. It can not jump and the unobstructed path must start with the diagonal movement. This piece is almost as powerful as the Queen and is inspired by the Giraffe from Tamerlane's Chess and the Aanca from Alfonso X's Grande Acedrex.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/eagle.png'>
</p>
<h2>Ship</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-ship.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>Originally invented for Tamerlane 2000, it moves one square diagonally and then, goes away of an indefinite number of cases vertically, never horizontally. It can move one square diagonally only. It can not jump and must begin its move with the diagonal step. The Ship is more limited than the Eagle (which can move horizontally). Nevertheless its move power is comparable to the Rook and the Bishop. When the Ship reaches the last row it promotes to an Eagle.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/ship.png'>
</p>
<h2>Camel</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-camel.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Metamachy, a well known piece from medieval Muslim great Chess like Tamerlane's Chess. It jumps to the opposite case of a 2x4 rectangle, like an extended Knight. No matter what intermediate cases contain. Note that it always stays on the same color of square. When a Camel reaches the last row it promotes to a Buffalo.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/camel.png'>
</p>
<h2>Cannon</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-cannon.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>As in Xiangqi, in Shako and in Metamachy. (Also known as Pao by problemists).</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/cannon.png'>
</p>
<h2>Bow</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-bow.png'>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>It is the diagonal counterpart of the Chinese Cannon. It moves like a Bishop and needs an intermediate piece between itself and its victim to capture it. The Bow jumps the intermediate and takes the victim on its square. The intermediate is left unaffected. (Also known as Vao by problemists).</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/bow.png'>
</p>
<h2>Buffalo</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-buffalo.png'>

<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/buffalo.png'>
</p>
<h2>Marshall</h2>
<p>
<img class='piece-icon' src='{GAME}/res/fairy/icons/w-marshall.png'>
</p>

(under many other names: Champion, Guard, Empress, Concubine, Chancellor, etc. The later is sometimes preferred, however it is confusing since Capablanca used it once for R+N and once for B+N. It is an Elephant in Seirawan Chess).</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/marshall.png'>

When a Bull reaches the last row it promotes to a Buffalo.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>
<p>
<img class='piece-graph' src='{GAME}/res/rules/graphs/bull.png'>
