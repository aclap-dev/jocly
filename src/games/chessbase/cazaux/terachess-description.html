<p>Bigger than bigger ! This is a Chess variant with 24 different pieces on a 16 x 16 board, an unrealistic summum.</p>

<p>They are 256 cases and 64 pieces per side which gives the same density than for Orthodox Chess.</p>

<p>In Terachess one will find again 20 kinds of men encountered in Shako , Tamerlane 2000, Metamachy and Gigachess. The 4 newcomers are the <b>Star</b> (Cannon+Bow), the <b>Rhinoceros</b>, a sort of Eagle's counterpart, the <b>Bull</b>, a long leaper whose move exists in Korean Chess and the <b>Antelope</b>, an original leaper.</p>
