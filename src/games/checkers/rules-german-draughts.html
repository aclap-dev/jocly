<p>In all Draughts variants, the following rules apply:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Players take turn by moving one piece</li>
	<li>Pieces can move to an adjacent empty position</li>
	<li>An adjacent opponent piece can be captured by jumping over it (which implies the next position is available)
		<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width:100%" src="{GAME}/res/rules/capture.jpg"/></p>
	</li>
	<li>When possible, several captures can be performed at the same round (with the same piece)</li>
</ul>

<p>In German Draughts, the additional rules also apply:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The board and initial position is the following:
		<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width:100%" src="{GAME}/res/rules/draughts8-start.jpg"/></p>
	</li>
	<li>Pieces moves only on dark squares</li>
	<li>Simple pieces can only move forward, except for capture</li>
	<li>Promoted pieces, called kings, can move along any diagonal</li>
	<li>White starts</li>
	<li>Capture is compulsory</li>
	<li>Captured pieces are removed at the end of the capture sequence</li>
	<li>If a player must choose between several capture sequences, he can choose any sequence as long as it ends to a position where no more capture is possible</li>
	<li>If a piece reaches the last line during a capture sequence, it is not promoted, unless the capture finishes on the last line</li>
	<li>A player who cannot play any move loses the game</li>
</ul>
