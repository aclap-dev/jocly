<p>Bigorra.</p>
<p>

In this variant : all the pieces of Terachess (II), completed by the pieces from Fantastic XIII are on the battlefield. Bigorra is then an alternative to Terachess II, somehow more complex because it has more pieces from more different types.

At Bigorra, the stronger pieces (Queen, Lion, Eagle, Buffalo, Duchess, etc.) are single as at Shako, Metamachy, Pemba, Zanzibar-XXL (Maasai Chess), or Gigachess (II). They do not come in pair as at Terachess.

In addition to a full line of Pawns, there are Soldiers and Trolls which are acting as "improved" Pawns and are balancing the large number of other pieces.

The idea of promotion for some non-Pawn pieces has been kept.</p>
