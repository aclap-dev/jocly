<p>Fantastic XIII.</p>
<p>

Who said that a chess-variant board should have even dimensions? 
Why not going with the odd number 13? This is the starting idea governing this chess-variant. 
An odd game should be different. That is its nature. Then, the army at fight in this game presents men which have not or seldom been used in my other games, despite they have a familiar style which make them easy to familiarize for the new players.
As it might be expected, there are 13 types of pieces in this game. Several of them have a long three-square distance effect which is perturbing. The atmosphere at play is weird. It is just fantastic. </p>
